                            Absolutely! This is a good trip for children of all ages. We have found however that children over the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more overall. A common concern we get from parents is that their children will be bored stuck on a boat for hours at a time. Surprisingly we deal with very few bored children of any age. The areas we are rafting through are some of the most beautiful in the world, and you never know what you might see around any corner. Each boat also comes equipped with a guide.

                            As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk.
                        
                            To help ensure your safety, our guides are all certified in Wilderness First Aid and all start with at least 3 years of rafting experience. The most common injuries are sunburns and injuries that occur on land.
