                            Absolutely! This is a good trip for children of all ages. We have found however that children over the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more overall. A common concern we get from parents is that their children will be bored stuck on a boat for hours at a time. Surprisingly we deal with very few bored children of any age. The areas we are rafting through are some of the most beautiful in the world, and you never know what you might see around any corner. Each boat also comes equipped with a guide.

                        Is whitewater rafting safe? I don't even know how to swim! Can I still come?

                            As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk.
                        
                            To help ensure your safety, our guides are all certified in Wilderness First Aid and all start with at least 3 years of rafting experience. The most common injuries are sunburns and injuries that occur on land.

                            We will provide all necessary camping equipment. This includes a sleeping bag, foam pad, waterproof duffle bag, small waterproof day bag, tent and a cot, eating utensils and camping chair. We provide water and lemonade during the day. Coffee, tea and hot chocolate are provided during the morning and evening hours. You may bring beer, liquor and soft drinks (in reasonable amounts, 2 cans per day).

                        What is so great about whitewater rafting anyway?

                            Arise in the soft light of the early morning after a night spent sleeping under a beautiful starry sky. Have a hearty warm breakfast of fresh blueberry pancakes or omelets to order, then pack your things and prepare for the day. The day is filled with some combination of swift water, rapids, calms, hikes, history, geology, stories, and more good food. We try to hit camp around 4 or 5, after setting up your cot you can relax with a good book or good company by the river.

                            If you have specific dates you need, we recommend booking a year in advance. If you can be more flexible, 6 months in advance is usually sufficient.
