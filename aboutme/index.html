        <h2>Kent</h2>
        <p>My name is Kenton. I am 23 living in South Africa. I am a huge fan of sports, mainly tennis, badminton, and rugby.</p>
        <p>I have been a member of the church my whole life. I have one older brother, who is 15 years older than me.</p>
        <p>I am an avid fan of computers, ie. coding. I love the idea of being able to imagine something, anything, and then being able to create it using code. My goal is to become a software developer. I have many more years to go, however this is the first step. I am excited to meet you all! </p>
