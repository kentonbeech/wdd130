      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        About Me. One of my favourite things to do, is play tennis. Ever since I was a little kid, I always remember my whole family sitting down, and watching Wimbledon (amongst other tournaments, i.e., Roland Garros, French Open, Australian Open, etc.). My favourite tennis player to watch is Roger Federer. I still remember how he used to play, his technique, how he could do impossible things to the ball. I really looked up to him.

        Another one of my hobbies is computers and coding. I've always had a love for that, the concept of being able to create anything you can imagine, all with some lines of code; it just fascinates me. 

        Some other hobbies include being in nature, so camping, hiking, the beach, going to watch a rugby match, cricket match, basically anything that involves spending time with my family and loved ones, and being outside. That is the perfect combination for me. 

        I am also currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Software Development. I have been studying for quite a few years now, while also pursuing freelance projects to apply my studies and knowledge to real-world situations. If you would like to see my completed projects, hit the link! Or reach out to me, and we can chat!
